        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Mugs4Medford was born with the mission to provide the Medford community with adequate mugs. According to a recent research by Harvufts University, Medford citizens own 0.3 mugs on average, a pathetic figure in comparison to the national average of 0.7. The benefits of having a mug is clear: you can drink water with it, you can drink coffer with it, you can even use it as a secret container to hide your favorite chocolates from your dog Annie.</p>
        <p>Below is an accurate and realistic illustration of how a cool mug (free!) can transform a man.</p>
